  <h1>All Common Ancestors Considered</h1>
  <p>
  To use this page:<br/>
  Enter a name for the DNA match group you're working on in the "name" box.
  Enter an URL or a GUID of a Geni profile in the "add" box.
  <p>
    The list of currently considered profiles will appear below the "add" box.
    To the right, there will be a list of groups, each of which shares a set
    of common ancestors.
    <br/>
    As you add profiles, the groups on the right may change, and
    their lists of common ancestors may shrink.
    <br/>
    The hope is that as you add more matching profiles, the groups will
    converge on a single set of ancestors that can be taken as "the source
    for that segment".
    <br/>
    The data is stored in "local storage" in your browser, so it should be
    recoverable after exiting the browser and restarting.
